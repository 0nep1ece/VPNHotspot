Connecting things to your VPN made simple. Share your VPN connection over hotspot or repeater. (**root required**)  
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.mygod.vpnhotspot" target="_blank"><img src="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en-play-badge.png" height="48"></a>

This app is useful for:

* Connecting things that don't support VPN like Chromecasts behind corporate firewalls;
* Set up [gapps](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158475) behind corporate firewalls;
* Connect to your mobile hotspot but you're not bothered to set up VPN on your device.

P.S. You can also do the similar on [Windows](https://www.expressvpn.com/support/vpn-setup/share-vpn-connection-windows/)
and [Mac](https://www.expressvpn.com/support/vpn-setup/share-vpn-connection-mac/).
I don't know about you but I can't get my stupid Windows 10 to work with
[hosted network](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd815243(v=vs.85).aspx)
now that they introduced this
[Mobile hotspot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027762/windows-use-your-pc-as-a-mobile-hotspot).

This app is designed to do only minimal changes to your system, so there's almost no chance you will brick your device
and/or break your Internet using this app *under normal conditions*. However there's also absolutely no guarantee it won't.

## Q & A

### Edit network name and/or password for repeater?

These are generated by Android system and can't be specified manually for now.
You can however request a credential reset using the button in this app.

### Connect a 2.4GHz-only device to a 5GHz repeater?

You'll have to use WPS for now to make the repeater switch to 2.4GHz.

### IPv6 tethering?

There's no IPv6 tethering in AOSP and I don't currently plan to support it either.

### Start repeater without VPN?

This app is designed for VPN interface as upstreams to simplify handling of connection change and NAT issues.
You could use stub VPN apps like [Adguard](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid)
together with this app as a workaround.

### No root?

Without root, you can only:

* View connected devices for system tethering and monitor them if your SELinux status is not enforcing
  (otherwise you can still do manual refreshes);
* Play around with settings;
* Alternatively you can use [NetShare-no-root-tethering](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kha.prog.mikrotik)
  (requires manual proxy configuration) for normal repeater tethering.
