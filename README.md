Share your VPN connection over hotspot or repeater. (root required)

## Q & A

### Can I change network name and/or password for repeater?

These are generated by Android system and can't be specified manually for now.
You can however request a credential reset using the button in this app.

### How to connect a 2.4GHz-only device to a 5GHz repeater?

You'll have to use WPS for now to make the repeater switch to 2.4GHz.

### IPv6 tethering?

There's no IPv6 tethering in AOSP and I don't currently plan to support it either.

### Can I use the repeater feature without enabling VPN?

This app is designed for VPN interface as upstreams to simplify handling of connection change and NAT issues.
You could use stub VPN apps like [Adguard](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid)
together with this app as a workaround.

### Can I use this app without root?

Without root, you can only:

* View connected devices for system tethering and monitor them if your SELinux status is not enforcing
  (otherwise you can still do manual refreshes);
* Play around with settings;
* Alternatively you can use [NetShare-no-root-tethering](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kha.prog.mikrotik)
  (requires manual proxy configuration) for normal repeater tethering.
